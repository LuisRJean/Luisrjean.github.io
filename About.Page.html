		I am a new college graduate with over a year of working experience doing internships alone as well as stand alone industry experience in a programming focused role. My hunger, drive, determination, and devotion to my craft let me gain over 5 years of Python coding and web development. My professional experience has led me to become more fluent and comfortable in data and backend. 
	<p>
		I love building things and leaving a positive impact not only in well carefully written code but solving and improving company issues. I'm attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I look to gain more working experience in a data scientist related role and branch out to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy math, physics and continuously learning.
